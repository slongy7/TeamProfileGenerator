# Team Profile Generator

## Description
This app is designed for a team being created using Node.js, and showing that information on a new html file along with .css.

## Bugs
I did not have great luck with this project.  I was able to get the questions running, but I was unable to have them show up in the html file.

## Usage
This runs through your command line, so use Inquirer to answer the questions.  You may see a walk through on YouTube.

## License
This is under the MIT license.
